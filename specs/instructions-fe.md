Have a look at the current mobile page https://m.aboutyou.de and define: 
1. Simple List of Business Critical Path Test you think that might be suitable for making sure that the basic functionality of the page is covered (with business-critical we mean the standard shopping conversion funnel up to the checkout).
2. Automated e2e test for the business critical path with a tool of your choice ( we're currently evaluating cypress.io ). If you have any questions feel free to shoot me a mail. If you take any shortcuts because of limited time you can just leave TODOs/ FIXMEs in the code.
